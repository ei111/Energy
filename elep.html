    <h1>Electric Potential Energy</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Electric potential energy is the energy stored in an electric field due to the relative positions of charged particles. It represents the work done to move a charge from one point to another within an electric field. Electric potential energy is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism and is crucial for understanding electrical interactions and circuits.</p>
        <p>The formula for electric potential energy (EPE) between two charges is:</p>
        <p><code>EPE = k × (q₁ × q₂) / r</code></p>
        <p>where <code>k</code> is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²), <code>q₁</code> and <code>q₂</code> are the magnitudes of the charges, and <code>r</code> is the distance between them. This equation indicates that the electric potential energy increases with the magnitude of the charges and decreases with the distance between them.</p>
        <p>Electric potential energy is a key concept in understanding electric fields and forces. It helps explain phenomena such as capacitor behavior, where energy is stored in the electric field between two conductive plates. In circuits, electric potential energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy in motors or thermal energy in resistors.</p>
        <p>In practical applications, electric potential energy is harnessed in various technologies, from batteries and capacitors to electric vehicles and power distribution systems. Understanding and manipulating electric potential energy enables the development of efficient and reliable electrical devices and systems.</p>
