                <h2>1. Kinetic Energy</h2>
                <p>Kinetic energy is the energy of an object due to its motion. The formula for kinetic energy is:</p>
                <p><code>KE = 0.5 × m × v²</code></p>
                <p>where <code>m</code> is the mass of the object and <code>v</code> is its velocity. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass and the square of the velocity.</p>
            
                <h2>2. Potential Energy</h2>
                <p>Potential energy is stored energy based on an object's position or state. There are several types:</p>
            
                <h3>2.1 Gravitational Potential Energy</h3>
                <p>Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored due to an object's height relative to a reference point. The formula is:</p>
                <p><code>GPE = m × g × h</code></p>
                <p>where <code>m</code> is the mass, <code>g</code> is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s² on Earth), and <code>h</code> is the height above the reference point.</p>
            
                <h3>2.2 Elastic Potential Energy</h3>
                <p>Elastic potential energy is stored in objects that can be stretched or compressed, such as springs. The formula is:</p>
                <p><code>EPE = 0.5 × k × x²</code></p>
                <p>where <code>k</code> is the spring constant and <code>x</code> is the displacement from the equilibrium position.</p>
            
                <h3>2.3 Chemical Potential Energy</h3>
                <p>Chemical potential energy is stored in the bonds of chemical compounds. It is released or absorbed during chemical reactions. There is no single formula for chemical potential energy, as it depends on the specific reaction and substances involved.</p>
            
                <h2>3. Thermal Energy</h2>
                <p>Thermal energy, also known as heat energy, is associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules. The formula for calculating heat energy change is:</p>
                <p><code>Q = mcΔT</code></p>
                <p>where <code>Q</code> is the heat energy, <code>m</code> is the mass, <code>c</code> is the specific heat capacity, and <code>ΔT</code> is the change in temperature.</p>
            
                <h2>4. Electrical Energy</h2>
                <p>Electrical energy is associated with the movement of electric charges. The formula for electrical energy is:</p>
                <p><code>EE = V × I × t</code></p>
                <p>where <code>V</code> is the voltage, <code>I</code> is the current, and <code>t</code> is the time for which the current flows.</p>
            
                <h2>5. Radiant Energy</h2>
                <p>Radiant energy is carried by electromagnetic waves. The energy of a photon in electromagnetic radiation is given by:</p>
                <p><code>E = h × f</code></p>
                <p>where <code>E</code> is the energy of the photon, <code>h</code> is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s), and <code>f</code> is the frequency of the radiation.</p>
            
                <h2>6. Energy Conservation</h2>
                <p>The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:</p>
                <p><code>ΔE = E₁ - E₂</code></p>
                <p>where <code>ΔE</code> is the change in energy, and <code>E₁</code> and <code>E₂</code> are the initial and final energy states of the system, respectively.</p>
            
                <h2>7. Power</h2>
                <p>Power is the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. The formula for power is:</p>
                <p><code>P = E / t</code></p>
                <p>where <code>P</code> is the power, <code>E</code> is the energy, and <code>t</code> is the time during which the energy transfer occurs.</p>
            
                <h2>8. Efficiency</h2>
                <p>Efficiency measures how effectively energy is converted from one form to another. The formula for efficiency is:</p>
                <p><code>η = (E_output / E_input) × 100%</code></p>
                <p>where <code>η</code> is the efficiency, <code>E_output</code> is the useful energy output, and <code>E_input</code> is the total energy input.</p>
            
                <h2>9. Work-Energy Principle</h2>
                <p>The work-energy principle states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. The formula is:</p>
                <p><code>W = ΔKE</code></p>
                <p>where <code>W</code> is the work done, and <code>ΔKE</code> is the change in kinetic energy.</p>
            
                <h2>10. Energy Units</h2>
                <p>Energy is measured in various units, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Joule (J):</strong> The SI unit of energy. 1 joule is equal to the energy required to move a 1-kilogram object by 1 meter against a force of 1 newton.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calorie (cal):</strong> Commonly used in nutrition, where 1 calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watt-hour (Wh):</strong> Used to measure electrical energy, where 1 watt-hour is the energy used by a device consuming 1 watt of power for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li><strong>British Thermal Unit (BTU):</strong> Used in heating and cooling, where 1 BTU is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1°F.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Understanding energy and its associated terms and formulas is essential for grasping fundamental concepts in physics and engineering. Energy is a versatile and vital quantity that influences a wide range of scientific and practical applications. By mastering these concepts, one can better understand and manage the energy systems that power our world.</p>
